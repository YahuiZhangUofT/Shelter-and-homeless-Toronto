Overview 

To conduct an in-depth analysis of Toronto's sheltered homeless population, I have extracted the data set 'Toronto Shelter System Flow' from the City of Toronto's open data portal. This analysis is to help the audiences grasp the social injustices faced by the most vulnerable groups in society.
